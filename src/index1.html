        How does React work?
    </h1>
    <p>React uses a declarative paradigm that makes it easier to reason about <br>  your application and aims to be both efficient and flexible. It designs simple <br> views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update <br> and render just the right component when your data changes.</p>
